/**
 * An Edge Shape Transformer class that simply encapsulates the generic QuadCurve and Line transformers.
 * This transformer is used to set the shape of an edge in a graph rendering.
 * For a P2PNetwork, connections between peers will be rendered as curves (quadcurves) and connections between 
 * peers and the docs that the peer publishes are rendered as straight lines. Note that the stroke is 
 * determined by another rendering class, and so is the length.
