TrustGrapher ChangeLog
----------------------

    Build 26
Trust graph works

    Build 27
Minor revisions before I add multiple view support

    Build 28
Now supports multiple views on screen

    Build 29
Added possible fix for mac right-clicking.  Needs to be tested
Finished Algorithm Configuration GUI.  Not yet fully integrated with TrustApplet
TrustApplet will load the visible algorithms specified by the configuration window.
TrustApplet will not yet load external class files

    Build 30
Added file filters for configuration window
Integrated TrustGraphLoader with Configure and BitStylus

    Build 31
Fixed a bug where the base was not being saved properly on the options window
The graphs specified by the options window are now loaded
Now loads external algorithms

    Build 32
Now supports switching between tabbed and grid views
Now loads external jars.  This will require a lot of fine-tuning.  The implementation is very sloppy

    Build 33
Added some idiot-proofing for the algorithm loader
Fixed remove algorithm button for algorithm loader
Refactoring and code optimization
An algorithm can now have a property file attached to it.  This is not yet implemented in the simulation however
The Property buttons and base field now disable when feedback history is selected
Remove class now works
Fixed a bug that did not allow you to load the maximum amount of algorithms at startup


-----
To Do
-----

    High Priority

    Low Priority
Change the base property to a key rather than index
Investigate possible layout mode bug
Fix jerky graph when switching to tabbed view
Remove time and start and end events on log window
Add graphic buttons for the playback bar
Fix Spring layout button
Integrate libraries into jar  (This is a NetBeans thing.  May have to make custom ant file.  dunno how to do that)
